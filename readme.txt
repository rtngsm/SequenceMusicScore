The xml_data contains the original xm files of music score. We use get_score.py to extract the score sequence from xml files and calculate the marginal frequency and transitions of pitch and beat. The estimator.py contains the SNB method, BIC model selection, and benchmark models. We use get_audio_feature.py to extract audio features from mp3 files. Mp3 files are too big to upload, but you can email us to get the full data. For comparison, we use get_wav_feature to get audio feture from different wav formats and use voting.py to implement the method of Cataltepe et al. (2007).
