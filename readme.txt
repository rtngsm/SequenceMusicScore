The xml_data contains the original xm files of music score. We use get_score.py to extract the score sequence from xml files and calculate the marginal frequency and transitions of pitch and beat. We then use get_audio_feature.py to extract audio features from mp3 files. These both contained in the totaldata_newscore_withnum.csv file. The estimator.py contains the SNB method, BIC model selection, and benchmark models. We use main.py to run the main results. Mp3 files are too big to upload, but you can contact us to get the full data. For comparison, we use get_wav_feature to get audio feture from different wav formats and use voting.py to implement the method of Cataltepe et al. (2007). The wav files are too big to up load, so we upload the feture files, they are, wav_feature_22_16.csv, wav_feature_22_32.csv, wav_feature_44_16.csv, wav_feature_44_32.csv, respectively. The result.csv contains the result from main.py.
